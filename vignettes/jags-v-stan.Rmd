Here we will compare and contrast the two different sampling backends that are
available to users of this library. There are far more indepth reviews of when
to use which sampler and why ([Beraha et al. 2021](#References); [Homan et al. 2014](#References)),
but, nevertheless, we can further add some guidance for this specific library.

### Setting up the Workflow. 

I'm going to skip over a lot of the background information on why measurement error
adjustment is important in dietary exposure assessment as there are many far more detailed
tutorials on this. We should begin by creating a custom dataset that can be used throughout
the entirety of this example. Normally dietary consumption data is characterized by a
gamma distribution ([Passerelli et al. 2022](#References)), so we that's the data that will be generated.
It is very important to note here that this library will standardize (i.e. make the
consumption distribution more normal) by default. So, please be careful when applying
this library to your dataset.

```{r}
x <- rgamma(100, shape = 1, rate = 0.01)
y <- rgamma(100, shape = 3, rate = 0.02)
z <- rgamma(100, shape = 3, rate = 0.3)
```

These will represent random consumption values, and accordingly, we will generate some
example output data that is linked to these input datas.

```{r}
output <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 3.5, sdlog = 0.2)
```

Thus, the full dataset looks like:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  list(x = x, y = y, z = z, output = output)
)

head(df, 10)

x_v_coef <- generate_coefficient(1000, 0.4, 0.7, 0.95)
y_v_coef <- generate_coefficient(1000, 0.5, 0.7, 0.95)
z_v_coef <- generate_coefficient(1000, 0.3, 0.6, 0.95)
```
```

### Stan vs. JAGS Pre-Model

With the data generated, we can now fit the pre-model to solve for the covariances
in the observed data. [Muoka et. al 2021](#References) created a very clever situation
where the JAGS sampler will converge quite quickly as the inverse-wishart distribution
is used to create a semi-conjugate prior situation. This of course does not guarantee
that the sampled posterior will be fully realized, but it does give the sampler that
much more of a chance to converge. From an API perspective, the same function to fit
the pre-model with a JAGS backend can be used to fit with a Stan backend. The only thing
that needs to be adjusted is the `stan = TRUE` parameter for the function.

```{r}
jags_output <- acme_model(df, c("x", "y", "z"))
```

```{r}
stan_output <- acme_model(df, c("x", "y", "z"), stan = TRUE)
```

Both of the models can be then introspected to see the underlying JAGS / Stan model code
along with samples to get a better understanding of how the samplers can yield slightly
different posteriors.

```{r}
jags_output$model
```

```{r}
stan_output$model
```

To show exactly how the samplers can create differing results. We can directly look at
the different metrics for the solved covariance structure as well as the actual resultant
covariance matrix.

```{r}
jags_output$covariance_matrix
```

```{r}
stan_output$covariance_matrix
```

As you can see the `sigma` values are quite similar, but the `rho` values vary quite a bit.
This has direct implications for what the resultant structure of the output coefficient 
adjustments will look like. As referenced above, the samplers explore the posterior space in
a bit of a different way, so this can lead to divergences between the two results. This should
not be viewed as an error as the posterior here is not mathematically directly estimatable,
but it is important to assess, for you, what makes more sense. The research team for this
library believes that the JAGS sampler is best, so it is the default argument. All results
from the Stan sampler should be viewed as experimental and not necessarily supported by the
maintainers.

### Stan vs. JAGS Error Adjustment

With the pre-model fit, now we can assess how the resulting coefficients are different depending
on which sampler is used.

```{r}
validity_coefficients <- c(x_v_coef, y_v_coef, z_v_coef)
jags_lambda <- attenuation_matrix(
  jags_output,
  c("x", "y", "z"),
  validity_coefficients
)
jags_model_output <- multivariate_model(
  "output ~ x + y + z",
  data = df,
  columns = c("x", "y", "z"),
  a_c_matrix = jags_lambda$matrix,
  sds = jags_lambda$sds,
  variances = jags_lambda$variances,
  univariate = TRUE
)
```

```{r}
validity_coefficients <- c(x_v_coef, y_v_coef, z_v_coef)
stan_lambda <- attenuation_matrix(
  stan_output,
  c("x", "y", "z"),
  validity_coefficients,
  stan = TRUE
)
stan_model_output <- multivariate_model(
  "output ~ x + y + z",
  data = df,
  columns = c("x", "y", "z"),
  a_c_matrix = stan_lambda$matrix,
  sds = stan_lambda$sds,
  variances = stan_lambda$variances,
  univariate = TRUE
)
```

Please be aware that the `stan = TRUE` parameter is passed to each step of the adjustment 
pipeline as the underlying libraries have slightly different APIs. This will prevent unexpected
errors if you accidentally try to pass a `rJags` object to a function expecting a
Stan object.

```{r}
jags_plots <- plot_covariates(jags_model_output, c("x", "y", "z"))
jags_plots$x
jags_plots$y
jags_plots$z
```

```{r}
stan_plots <- plot_covariates(stan_model_output, c("x", "y", "z"))
stan_plots$x
stan_plots$y
stan_plots$z
```

Again, the differing pre-model results yield different adjustments for our synthetic
dataset. It is worth repeating that one is not necessarily more accurate, but the
divergences should be treated as important data points when assessing the measurement
error structure in your own dataset.

### Traceplots

And accordingly, the traceplots can be assessed to make sure that both the samplers
have converged.

```{r}
traceplots(stan_output$samples, c("x", "y", "z"), pre_model = TRUE, stan = TRUE)
```

```{r}
traceplots(jags_output$samples, c("x", "y", "z"), pre_model = TRUE)
```
