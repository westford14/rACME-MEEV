\description{
Using the methodology generated by Muoko et. al (see README for
full citation), run the modelling with the JAGS sampler. This model
uses the calculated attenuation-contamination matrix to adjust
the various covariates needed in the model. The function accepts
the computed pre-model, the attenuation-contamination coefficient,,
a model string, and standard deviations. There is an optional
argument for also fitting the univariate model to run further
comparisons between the naive, univariate, and multivariate models
in later steps.
